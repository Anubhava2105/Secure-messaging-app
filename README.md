# Secure Messaging App

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging application that prioritizes user privacy and data security. The application will allow users to send text messages, images, and files securely without fear of interception or unauthorized access.

### Key Features
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device.
- **Self-Destructing Messages**: Option to set timers for messages to automatically delete after being viewed.
- **No Logs Policy**: We do not store any metadata or message logs on our servers.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on iOS, Android, and Web.
